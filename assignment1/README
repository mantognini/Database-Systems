For testing purpose, the following fish function can be used to run the project
locally on 4 threads, assuming output/expected is filled in by correct data.

function testdb
	sbt package ^&1 > log.err.txt
  and rm -fr output/out
  and spark-submit --class "main.scala.Project1" \
                   --master "local[4]" \
                   target/scala-2.11/Project1.jar \
                   input output ^^ log.err.txt | tee log.out.txt
  and test -d output/out/
  and cat output/out/* | sort -n | cmp output/expected -
  and echo "Success!"; or begin
      echo "Failure"
      cat log.err.txt
      test -d output/out/
      and cat output/out/* | sort -n | diff output/expected -
  end
end
